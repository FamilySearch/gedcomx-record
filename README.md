The GEDCOMX-Record project is an extension to [GEDCOM X](http://www.gedcomx.org) to define support for
exchanging the results of large-scale, field-based extraction of record data from digital images.

The formal specification for the GEDCOM X record extension is [found here](specifications/record-specification.md).

[There is also a non-normative guide available](Processing-Gedcomx-Record.md) for processing a record.
